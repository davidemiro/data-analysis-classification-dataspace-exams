This course covers the following topics:

- Fundamentals of statistics and probability.
- Strategies for feature extraction such as PCA (Principal Component Analysis).
- Machine Learning algorithms including k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, random forest, logistic regression, and Support Vector Machine.
- Strategies for the proper application of Machine Learning algorithms to avoid overfitting and optimize hyperparameters, like Cross Validation.
- Proper data visualization techniques.
- The use of Python libraries such as Scikit-learn, Numpy, and Pandas.
